# Scrapix

Welcome to Scrapix, a web application developed as our group coursework project for Year 2 BSc (Hons) Computing Science, specifically for the Software Engineering course. Scrapix is designed as a platform for users to document, organize, annotate, and share memories with others. The project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, without any web framework or UI library.

## Features
1. **Sign Up with Password Validation**: Users can sign up for a Scrapix account using an email and create a unique username and password with password validation criteria to ensure the creation of strong passwords.
2. **Posting**: Users can post media content, including text and images, to Scrapix. The posted content is publicly viewable on the user's homepage for other Scrapix users.
3. **Like and Comment**: Users can interact with posts by liking them and leaving comments, fostering engagement and communication within the Scrapix community.
4. **Support for Media Types**: Scrapix supports media types such as JPEG, PNG, JPG, and GIF, allowing users to upload a variety of files for their posts and scrapbook creations.
5. **Camera Implementation**: Users can upload photos captured by their device's camera, adding a personal touch to their content-sharing experience.
6. **Scrapbook**: Users can create and design virtual scrapbooks using images, stickers, and texts. Scrapix provides an HTML canvas for users to decorate their scrapbooks by uploading images, inserting texts, and arranging elements in a desired layout. Users can share their scrapbooks with others by posting them to Scrapix.
7. **Browsing Content with Physical Location**: Users can explore content posted by other Scrapix users based on their current physical location, enhancing the connection between users in the same geographical area.
8. **Responsive Web Design**: Scrapix incorporates responsive web design, ensuring that web pages are displayed in a user-friendly manner on different devices and screen sizes.

## JavaScript Libraries Used
- **Dynamsoft Camera Enhancer SDK:** Enables easy control of cameras on users' desktops and mobile devices.

- **HTML Geolocation API:** Retrieves the geographical position of users, providing latitude and longitude coordinates.

- **LocationIQ API:** Converts position coordinates into human-readable addresses and categorizes users' locations into cities.

## Development Setup
1. Install XAMPP to set up a local server.
2. Configure XAMPP with Apache and MySQL for hosting Scrapix locally.
3. Clone the repository.
4. Open the project using XAMPP's htdocs directory.
5. Start Apache and MySQL servers in XAMPP.
6. Access Scrapix through `http://localhost/Scrapix` in your web browser.

## Note
This application is currently only available on the localhost server. The development environment uses XAMPP Apache and MySQL to host Scrapix locally.

Feel free to explore, share memories, and create your virtual scrapbooks with Scrapix!
